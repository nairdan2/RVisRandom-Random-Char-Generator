# RVisRandom-Random-Char-Generator
A random char generator!

Generates a txt file filled with random chars(a-z, A-Z, 0-9).

You can specify how long the lines will be and how many!
The limit for line length and line count is 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (unsigned __int64) however setting 
both variables this high would generate a file 281,474,976,710,655 YobiByte big and would probably take years to generate.
So, there is no real limit other than free space on your HDD :P

Also one of my first programs ever and actually this was only programmed for another program I'm working on(encryption).

Get the EXE in the release section, or build it yourself!

Have fun generating useless chars, I guess..!
